# Basic Concepts

G1 is a generational, incremental, parallel, mostly concurrent, stop-the-world, and evacuating  
garbage collector which monitors pause-time goals in each of the stop-the-world pauses.  
Similar to other collectors, G1 splits the heap into (virtual) young and old generations.  
Space-reclamation efforts concentrate on the young generation where it is most efficient to do so,  
with occasional space-reclamation in the old generation.

Some operations are always performed in stop-the-world pauses to improve throughput. Other 
operations that would take more time with the application stopped such as whole-heap operations 
like global marking are performed in parallel and concurrently with the application. To keep 
stop-the-world pauses short for space-reclamation, G1 performs space-reclamation incrementally 
in steps and in parallel. G1 achieves predictability by tracking information about previous 
application behavior and garbage collection pauses to build a model of the associated costs. It 
uses this information to size the work done in the pauses. For example, G1 reclaims space in the 
most efficient areas first (that is the areas that are mostly filled with garbage, therefore the name).

G1 reclaims space mostly by using evacuation: live objects found within selected memory areas to 
collect are copied into new memory areas, compacting them in the process. After an evacuation has 
been completed, the space previously occupied by live objects is reused for allocation 
by the application.

The Garbage-First collector is not a real-time collector. It tries to meet set pause-time targets 
with high probability over a longer time, but not always with absolute certainty for a given pause.

# Heap Layout

G1 partitions the heap into a set of equally sized heap regions, each a contiguous range of virtual 
memory as shown in Figure 9-1. A region is the unit of memory allocation and memory reclamation. 
At any given time, each of these regions can be empty (light gray), or assigned to a particular 
generation, young or old. As requests for memory comes in, the memory manager hands out free regions. 
The memory manager assigns them to a generation and then returns them to the application as free 
space into which it can allocate itself.


The young generation contains eden regions (red) and survivor regions (red with "S"). These regions 
provide the same function as the respective contiguous spaces in other collectors, with the 
difference that in G1 these regions are typically laid out in a noncontiguous pattern in memory. 
Old regions (light blue) make up the old generation. Old generation regions may be humongous 
(light blue with "H") for objects that span multiple regions.

An application always allocates into a young generation, that is, eden regions, with the exception 
of humongous, objects that are directly allocated as belonging to the old generation.

G1 garbage collection pauses can reclaim space in the young generation as a whole, and any 
additional set of old generation regions at any collection pause. During the pause G1 copies objects 
from this collection set to one or more different regions in the heap. The destination region for 
an object depends on the source region of that object: the entire young generation is copied into 
either survivor or old regions, and objects from old regions to other, different old 
regions using aging.

# Garbage Collection Cycle

On a high level, the G1 collector alternates between two phases. The young-only phase contains 
garbage collections that fill up the currently available memory with objects in the old generation 
gradually. The space-reclamation phase is where G1 reclaims space in the old generation 
incrementally, in addition to handling the young generation. Then the cycle restarts 
with a young-only phase.

The following list describes the phases, their pauses and the transition between the phases 
of the G1 garbage collection cycle in detail:

Young-only phase: This phase starts with a few young-only collections that promote objects 
into the old generation. The transition between the young-only phase and the space-reclamation 
phase starts when the old generation occupancy reaches a certain threshold, 
the Initiating Heap Occupancy threshold. At this time, G1 schedules an Initial Mark young-only 
collection instead of a regular young-only collection.

Initial Mark : This type of collection starts the marking process in addition to performing 
a regular young-only collection. Concurrent marking determines all currently 
reachable (live) objects in the old generation regions to be kept for the following 
space-reclamation phase. While marking hasn’t completely finished, regular young 
collections may occur. Marking finishes with two special stop-the-world pauses: 
Remark and Cleanup.

Remark: This pause finalizes the marking itself, and performs global reference processing and 
class unloading. Between Remark and Cleanup G1 calculates a summary of the liveness information 
concurrently, which will be finalized and used in the Cleanup pause to update internal data structures.

Cleanup: This pause also reclaims completely empty regions, and determines whether 
a space-reclamation phase will actually follow. If a space-reclamation phase follows, 
the young-only phase completes with a single young-only collection.

Space-reclamation phase: This phase consists of multiple mixed collections that in addition 
to young generation regions, also evacuate live objects of sets of old generation regions. 
The space-reclamation phase ends when G1 determines that evacuating more old generation regions 
wouldn't yield enough free space worth the effort.

After space-reclamation, the collection cycle restarts with another young-only phase. As backup, 
if the application runs out of memory while gathering liveness information, G1 performs an in-place 
stop-the-world full heap compaction (Full GC) like other collectors.

Garbage-First Internals

This section describes some important details of the Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector.
Determining Initiating Heap Occupancy

The Initiating Heap Occupancy Percent (IHOP) is the threshold at which an Initial Mark collection 
is triggered and it is defined as a percentage of the old generation size.

G1 by default automatically determines an optimal IHOP by observing how long marking takes 
and how much memory is typically allocated in the old generation during marking cycles. 
This feature is called Adaptive IHOP. If this feature is active, then 
the option -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent determines the initial value as a percentage 
of the size of the current old generation as long as there aren't enough observations to make 
a good prediction of the Initiating Heap Occupancy threshold. Turn off this behavior of G1 using 
the option-XX:-G1UseAdaptiveIHOP. In this case, the value of -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent 
always determines this threshold.

Internally, Adaptive IHOP tries to set the Initiating Heap Occupancy so that the first mixed 
garbage collection of the space-reclamation phase starts when the old generation occupancy is at 
a current maximum old generation size minus the value of -XX:G1HeapReservePercent as the extra buffer.
Marking

G1 marking uses an algorithm called Snapshot-At-The-Beginning (SATB) . It takes a virtual snapshot 
of the heap at the time of the Initial Mark pause, when all objects that were live at the start 
of marking are considered live for the remainder of marking. This means that objects that become 
dead (unreachable) during marking are still considered live for the purpose of space-reclamation 
(with some exceptions). This may cause some additional memory wrongly retained compared to other 
collectors. However, SATB potentially provides better latency during the Remark pause. 
The too conservatively considered live objects during that marking will be reclaimed during 
the next marking. See the Garbage-First Garbage Collector Tuning topic for more information about 
problems with marking.
Behavior in Very Tight Heap Situations

When the application keeps alive so much memory so that an evacuation can't find enough space 
to copy to, an evacuation failure occurs. Evacuation failure means that G1 tries to complete the 
current garbage collection by keeping any objects that have already been moved in their new location, 
and not copying any not yet moved objects, only adjusting references between the object. 
Evacuation failure may incur some additional overhead, but generally should be as fast as other 
young collections. After this garbage collection with the evacuation failure, G1 will resume the 
application as normal without any other measures. G1 assumes that the evacuation failure occurred 
close to the end of the garbage collection; that is, most objects were already moved and there is 
enough space left to continue running the application until marking completes 
and space-reclamation starts.

If this assumption doesn’t hold, then G1 will eventually schedule a Full GC. This type of collection 
performs in-place compaction of the entire heap. This might be very slow.

See Garbage-First Garbage Collector Tuning for more information about problems with allocation 
failure or Full GC's before signalling out of memory.
Humongous Objects

Humongous objects are objects larger or equal the size of half a region. The current region size 
is determined ergonomically as described in the Ergonomic Defaults for G1 GC section, 
unless set using the -XX:G1HeapRegionSize option.
These humongous objects are sometimes treated in special ways:

Every humongous object gets allocated as a sequence of contiguous regions in the old generation. 
The start of the object itself is always located at the start of the first region in that sequence. 
Any leftover space in the last region of the sequence will be lost for allocation until 
the entire object is reclaimed.
Generally, humongous objects can be reclaimed only at the end of marking during the Cleanup pause, 
or during Full GC if they became unreachable. There is, however, a special provision for humongous 
objects for arrays of primitive types for example, bool, all kinds of integers, and floating point 
values. G1 opportunistically tries to reclaim humongous objects if they are not referenced by many 
objects at any kind of garbage collection pause. This behavior is enabled by default but you can 
disable it with the option -XX:G1EagerReclaimHumongousObjects.
Allocations of humongous objects may cause garbage collection pauses to occur prematurely. 
G1 checks the Initiating Heap Occupancy threshold at every humongous object allocation and may 
force an initial mark young collection immediately, if current occupancy exceeds that threshold.
The humongous objects never move, not even during a Full GC. This can cause premature slow Full GCs 
or unexpected out-of-memory conditions with lots of free space left due to fragmentation 
of the region space.

Young-Only Phase Generation Sizing

During the young-only phase, the set of regions to collect (collection set), consists only 
of young generation regions. G1 always sizes the young generation at the end of 
a young-only collection. This way, G1 can meet the pause time goals that were set using 
-XX:MaxGCPauseTimeMillis and -XX:PauseTimeIntervalMillis based on long-term observations of actual 
pause time. It takes into account how long it took young generations of similar size to evacuate. 
This includes information like how many objects had to be copied during collection, 
and how interconnected these objects had been.

If not otherwise constrained, then G1 adaptively sizes the young generation size between the 
values that -XX:G1NewSizePercent and -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent determine to meet pause-time. 
See Garbage-First Garbage Collector Tuning  for more information about how to fix long pauses.
Space-Reclamation Phase Generation Sizing

During the space-reclamation phase, G1 tries to maximize the amount of space that's reclaimed 
in the old generation in a single garbage collection pause. The size of the young generation is 
set to minimum allowed, typically as determined by -XX:G1NewSizePercent, and any old generation 
regions to reclaim space are added until G1 determines that adding further regions will exceed 
the pause time goal. In a particular garbage collection pause, G1 adds old generation regions 
in order of their reclamation efficiency, highest first, and the remaining available time 
to get the final collection set.

The number of old generation regions to take per garbage collection is bounded at the lower end by 
the number of potential candidate old generation regions (collection set candidate regions) 
to collect, divided by the length of the space-reclamation phase as determined 
by -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget. The collection set candidate regions are all old generation regions 
that have an occupancy that's lower than -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent at the start of the phase.


| Option and Default Value | Description |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 | The goal for the maximum pause time. |
| -XX:GCPauseTimeInterval=<ergo> | The goal for the maximum pause time interval. By default G1 doesn’t set any goal, allowing G1 to perform garbage collections back-to-back in extreme cases. |
| -XX:ParallelGCThreads=<ergo> | The maximum number of threads used for parallel work during garbage collection pauses. This is derived from the number of available threads of the computer that the VM runs on in the following way: if the number of CPU threads available to the process is fewer than or equal to 8, use that. Otherwise add five eighths of the threads greater than to the final number of threads.
| -XX:ConcGCThreads=<ergo> | The maximum number of threads used for concurrent work. By default, this value is -XX:ParallelGCThreads divided by 4.
| -XX:+G1UseAdaptiveIHOP & -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=45 | Defaults for controlling the initiating heap occupancy indicate that adaptive determination of that value is turned on, and that for the first few collection cycles G1 will use an occupancy of 45% of the old generation as mark start threshold. |
| -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=<ergo> | The set of the heap region size based on initial and maximum heap size. So that heap contains roughly 2048 heap regions. The size of a heap region can vary from 1 to 32 MB, and must be a power of 2. |
| -XX:G1NewSizePercent=5 & -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=60 | The size of the young generation in total, which varies between these two values as percentages of the current Java heap in use. |
| -XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5 | The allowed unreclaimed space in the collection set candidates as a percentage. G1 stops the space-reclamation phase if the free space in the collection set candidates is lower than that. |
| -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=8 | The expected length of the space-reclamation phase in a number of collections. |
| -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=85 | Old generation regions with higher live object occupancy than this percentage aren't collected in this space-reclamation phase. |
